    Worker stats have been improved. Now your workers are sorted (numerically/alphabetically).
    Also, if you're using PPAgent you'll notice it now calculates your WU, Total Hashrate, and
    WUE at the worker level. The WUE has a status indicator to give you an idea of the health
    at a glance. In the next few days(pt 2) we'll be rolling out temperature and hashrate graphs
    for ppagent stats.

    Last night we had a minor issue with our queueing server that caused work to
    be lost for about 12 minutes (~4:17-4:29 GMT) while we patched it live. We've 
    fixed the issue and do not expect it to be a problem in the future.
